# Taxi-Demand-Predict
the purpose of this repository is  to predict the demand for 263 zones of NYC in the future.
Predicting the demand for taxi drivers in specific zones, such as Zone 263 in NYC, typically involves building a regression model based on historical data. 
Here's a step-by-step guide on how you might approach this problem:
1- Data Collection:
2- Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values in the dataset.
Convert timestamp data into features like day of the week, time of day, etc.
Explore and transform features as needed (e.g., one-hot encoding for weekdays).
3- Feature Engineering:
Create additional features that might impact demand. Aggregate data at an appropriate level, like hourly or daily.
4- Train-Test Split:
Split your dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

5- Model Selection:
Choose a regression model suitable for your problem. Common choices include:
Decision Tree Regressor
GradientBoostRegressor 
XGBoost Regressor
6-  Model Training:
Train your selected model using the training dataset.

7-  Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.
